# Timeline, Presentation, and Resume

**Status:** Reconciled implementation specification  
**Baseline:** Mentora Architecture Baseline 1.0  
**Purpose:** Coordinate speech, visuals, cancellation, and semantic continuation.

## Dependencies

- `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
- `governance/DECISION_LEDGER.yaml`
- `governance/TERMINOLOGY_REGISTRY.yaml`

## Normative Language

**MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are requirements. Technology choices explicitly marked `PROPOSED` are not binding until accepted.

---

Use marker priority: native TTS marker, forced alignment, audio PTS, estimated offset, segment fallback. Presentation events include deadline policy and target version. Client ignores duplicate/stale generations/events and reports sequence gaps.

Audio cancellation names cancel-through generation; client stops/clears/discards/ACKs. Checkpoint precedes student invitation. Resume validates versions/checkpoint, restores presentation, generates bridge phrase, and starts new segment/generation.
