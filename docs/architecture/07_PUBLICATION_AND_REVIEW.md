# Publication, Review, and Teacher Studio

**Status:** Reconciled implementation specification  
**Baseline:** Mentora Architecture Baseline 1.0  
**Purpose:** Define approval policy and atomic visibility.

## Dependencies

- `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
- `governance/DECISION_LEDGER.yaml`
- `governance/TERMINOLOGY_REGISTRY.yaml`

## Normative Language

**MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are requirements. Technology choices explicitly marked `PROPOSED` are not binding until accepted.

---

Review outcomes are auto-allowed, human-required, or blocked. Conflicting notes/source, meaning-affecting degradation, unsupported reveal, AI assessments, weak evidence, regulated content, and executable content trigger review/block according to policy.

Atomic publication validates references/schemas/checksums/provenance, writes immutable package, builds compatible pinned index, commits metadata/outbox, then exposes the version. Corrections create new versions.

## Locked Decisions Implemented

- `DEC-CONTENT-005`
- `DEC-CONTENT-008`
- `DEC-DATA-005`
