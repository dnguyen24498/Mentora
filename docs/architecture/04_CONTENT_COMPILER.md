# Content Compiler Architecture

**Status:** Reconciled implementation specification  
**Baseline:** Mentora Architecture Baseline 1.0  
**Purpose:** Specify secure deterministic compilation and selective enrichment.

## Dependencies

- `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
- `governance/DECISION_LEDGER.yaml`
- `governance/TERMINOLOGY_REGISTRY.yaml`

## Normative Language

**MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are requirements. Technology choices explicitly marked `PROPOSED` are not binding until accepted.

## Pipeline

Validate/scan/store -> structural extraction -> rendering router -> media processing -> reveal semantics -> Content IR -> baseline builder -> selective AI enrichment -> validation.

## Rendering

Record engine/version/fonts/warnings/provenance and classify native-compatible-structural-degraded-failed. Failed blocks publication; degraded meaning requires review.

## Vision

Invoked only for scans, diagrams, complex charts, SmartArt fallback, or meaning carried by position/color/arrows. Every invocation records reason, model/prompt versions, source refs, confidence, and review state.

## Security/reproducibility

Sandbox untrusted files, never execute macros/scripts/OLE, bound resources and archive expansion. Deterministic cache key uses source checksum, compiler version, and config hash.

## Locked Decisions Implemented

- `DEC-CONTENT-001`
- `DEC-CONTENT-002`
- `DEC-CONTENT-006`
- `DEC-CONTENT-009`
